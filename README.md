Welcome to the Checkmater docs. You can always go back to the Checkmater by clicking [here](https://checkmater.ugljesa.hackclub.app).

Since this project on my own ([@ukicomputers](https://github.com/ukicomputers)) and I really put hard work on the project, I would appreciate some small donation, you can do it by buying calculations on the site. Thanks :)

We are constantly improving the overall function scope. Here are some things that are currently in progress (or some issues that requires fix):
- [feature] Developing automatic import of chess pieces via image.

**note** this section is changed constantly, so you can see current things that are developing. you can always report a problem, or new project idea [here](https://checkmater.ugljesa.hackclub.app/report).
