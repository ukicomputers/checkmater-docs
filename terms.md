## Checkmater is currently down!
We sometimes go for maintnace down, and the usual maintnance duration is about ~5 minutes, and the maximal duration is probably around an hour. In some rare cases, we may be down for an extended period of time, and in that cases, you can relate to the current status of the Checkmater on the home page of the docs (since documentation will be always up). If you still encounter issues, please contact us via email `checkmater.app@gmail.com`.

## Thinking time is over an set period of time!
Firstly, before all, **you will be only charged for selected amount of time**, there will be no charges for more time thinked than the selected amount. The pricing will always be *thinking time in milliseconds / (divided by) 1000* and rounded up near two decimal places.

Second, you may ask **why the engine broke the thinking time limited by me**? That's because engine thinks for that expected amount of time as you set, but sometimes, the server is overloaded or there will be other outside factors for thinking it more. You can think that you can't break something in middle of work, otherwise, the results will be faulty, and probably incorrect at all.

## Why do first batch of calculations cost differently than normal batch?
*note* they usually cost €0.49, and the normal batch costs €0.1 (of 100 calculations)

That is because we use **Lemon Squeezy** as our **M**erchant **O**f **R**ecords (or better to say, the payment processor), and they require minimal cost of the product, which is in this case **€0.49**. Currently, there is nothing that we can do, because we are not real company, but the service run by individual, so we are using **MOR**. We will maybe switch to the other payment processors in the future. We are really sorry for this inconvenice.
