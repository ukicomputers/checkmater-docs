## Why do first batch of calculations cost differently than normal batch?
*note* they usually cost €0.49, and the normal batch costs €0.1 (of 100 calculations)

That is because we use **Lemon Squeezy** as our **M**erchant **O**f **R**ecords (or better to say, the payment processor), and they require minimal cost of the product, which is in this case **€0.49**. Currently, there is nothing that we can do, because we are not real company, but the service run by individual, so we are using **MOR**. We will maybe switch to the other payment processors in the future. We are really sorry for this inconvenice.
