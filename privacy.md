# Privacy Policy
This section of the document is explaining how we process your data to use our services. We do not collect much data of the users, nor do we follow you with cookies (only cookie that is registered on your system will be used only for signing in, which is required almost on every service that has sign in processing). You can always go back to the Checkmater by clicking [here](https://checkmater.ugljesa.hackclub.app).

## Data collected about you
We only save the data provided **default** by the Google OAuth service (authentication service made by Google to allow signing in with the Google account). And that is:
- Email (used to show in the menu; **picture 1**, and to show in paying statements; **picture 2**)
- Your full name defaulted from your Google account (used to show in paying statements; **picture 2**)
- Calculations on your account (required by Checkmater)

For every payment, we only collect:
- The cost of the payment
- Date of payment

Note that we **don't collect**:
- Your payment (credit/debit) card number and anything related to that
- Type of card that you are paying with (like Visa/Mastercard etc.)
- Last four digits of your payment (credit/debit) card
- Anything password related or account access related to your Google profile (account)

All payments are processed by our Merchant of Records, **Lemon Squeezy**. For other payment privacy policies please refer to them ([link](https://www.lemonsqueezy.com/privacy)).

You can see also below **picture 3** on how you appear in our database, and **picture 4** on how payment appears in our database.

## Data usage & sharing
We strictly **DO NOT** share **any information** collected about you, or your Checkmater usage without anyone! All the data is private and handled internally. Rest assured, you are good to go.
